# Lambda Functions Collection

> Collection of lambda functions to perform personal micro tasks

## Why

In the past, for every backend task no matter the size of it, I used to create small node servers and host to heroku. Despite of working well for all these years, I have a bunch of complete and spread servers to, sometimes, do a very minor task which I can't perform client side.

Luckily the year is 2021 and we have lambda functions services where I can just write those tiny functions to run in an existing server somewhere. ðŸ˜ƒ
